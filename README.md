# Welcome to PyCLOCK BOT ðŸ¤–

PyCLOCK BOT is a daily clock in & out system. It is a web application written in Python based on the libraries of *Pandas* and *Streamlit*.

## Features

- Dashboards display the daily, monthly and yearly information.
- Macros for different countries and working principles (e.g. weekly working time and annual leave days etc.). Users can change those macros to accommodate the situation.
- Simple and neat interface, the month report is displayed in a tabular view.
- The yearly report is generated under the repository ***docs***, each monthly report is saved in a separate sheet.
- Multiple break sessions are involved. It is allowed for users to set different breaks in a day, and the actual working hour will be self adapted.
 
## Run

```python pyclock_bot.py```
